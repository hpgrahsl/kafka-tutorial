= Developing Kafka Streams in Java
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this example, we are going to develop an example to build a music chart to see the number of times that a song has been played.

There is one service (`player-app`) that it is periodically producing played songs to the `played-songs` topic.
This service is not using Kafka Streams but instead just uses the Kafka producer API under the covers of Smallrye Reactive Messaging for Kafka.

The second service is a Kafka Stream application that joins the `songs` and `played-songs` topics, to get the song name. Also it computes the number of times that each particular song has been played by aggregating the joined records based on the song's id.

include::partial$kafka-up-dc.adoc[]

You need to open 2 terminal windows to run this example, one for each service.

[#player-songs-java]
== Player Service

The producer code is at {github-repo}/{apps-folder}/player-app[Player Service, window=_blank].

[#deploying-player-app]
=== Deploying Player Service

In this case, the Quarkus service is deployed to produce played songs.
You've got two options, using the existing Docker image or building the service and image yourself. Note, that due to the configured Quarkus extension `quarkus-container-image-jib` the container image will be build automatically when you trigger the local build.
In terminal 1, run one of these two options:
